# NAB-Corpus
The NAB corpus of 58 timeseries data files is designed to provide data for research in streaming anomaly detection. It is comprised of both real-world and artifical timeseries data containing labeled anomalous periods of behavior. Data are ordered, timestamped, single-valued metrics. All data files contain anomalies, unless otherwise noted.
